## Overview

In modern intelligent systems, real-time decision making is critical. This project provides an integrated framework that:
- **Segments objects** in video frames.
- **Tracks object movements** over time.
- **Estimates collision risk** based on object trajectories and distances.

By combining these components, the system enhances situational awareness and assists in proactive collision avoidance.

## Features

- **Segmentation:** MASK-RCNN from Detectron2 to accurately separate objects from the background.
- **Tracking:** Robust tracking algorithms to monitor objects through successive frames.
- **Collision Risk Estimation:** Analyzes object trajectories to calculate the likelihood of collisions.
- **Modular Design:** Each component is designed to work independently and can be adapted to different environments or datasets.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhrumil-Kotadia/Vision_Based_Segmentation-Tracking-Collision_Risk_Estimation.git
   cd Vision_Based_Segmentation-Tracking-Collision_Risk_Estimation
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:
